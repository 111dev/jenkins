Access Jenkins: Jenkins runs on port 8080 by default. You can access it by navigating to http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080 in your web browser.

To unlock Jenkins for the first time, you'll need the initial admin password, which you can retrieve using:



sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
